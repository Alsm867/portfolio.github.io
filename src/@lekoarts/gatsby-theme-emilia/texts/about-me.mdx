# About Me

Programming was never first on my list. I was intimidated by it, so why have it on my list in the first place, right? I always thought it was interesting, but never took a second thought about trying to learn it. That is, until I had seen what the machines could do at my last job. We built office furniture and I noticed the machines would bore holes into parts at precise locations and at precise depths. It amazed me how they knew what to do and when to do their job. After that, I started asking questions about everything. How does a video game do what it does? How does a website display certain info or have buttons that do certain actions? I decided to seek answers to these questions by looking up videos and eventually looking for a school or program to learn all of this, and I can’t wait to utilize what I’ve learned!
