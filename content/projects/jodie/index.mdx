My group and I cloned StackOverflow using vanilla javascript, pug, and
express. Our website has a theme of pets and pet related questions. We
utilized Op.iLike to implement a functional search bar so users can search
for topics, specific types of pets, and search questions. The user can ask a
question and others can post their answers to those questions, as well as
up-vote or down-vote the question itself or the answers to those questions.
