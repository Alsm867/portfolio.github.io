# LG Chem

I worked on the quality assurance team where we would inspect the x-rays of car batteries looking for defects or flaws on them. We mainly looked for tears in the cells fo the batteries. If a cell had a tear it would function properly and will fail once the car was being tested.

# Herman Miller

I started as an assembly line worker where I learned all the positions they had in the assembly line as well as the machine operating part of the Casegoods department. I learned the entire process that goes into building the furniture from machining all the parts and putting it all together as well as all the components that went into them(drawers, doors, handles, drawer slides, etc.). I made it my mission to learn everything, and I accomplished that mission by the time I left that company. I moved up to a position called Responder where I was put in charge of 5 assembly lines. I was tasked with making sure the lines were running smoothly, fixing any machine or tool that went down(if I couldn’t fix it within 3 mins I would call maintenance to fix it so I can get production moving as quickly as possible). I would write any struggles that a line would have had every hour on what we called an hour by hour chart, so that my higher ups will know what slowed down production or why we didn’t meet that hour's goal. I was also in charge of who worked on what line for that day to utilize everyone’s skills in the right spots on the line for better production.

# Temp Worker

I was a temp worker for Herman Miller through the Adecco agency where I worked at two different departments. One department was to refill the fabric needed for three different lines. I was in charge of pulling manifests that told me what fabric was needed and for what line, and I had to locate the fabric and bring it to the line before they ran out of work. The second department I was pulling manifests that told me what boxes were needed for what department. I would locate the boxes in bulk and place them on carts and bring them to the department that needed them. the boxes in bulk and place them on carts and bring them to the department that needed them.
