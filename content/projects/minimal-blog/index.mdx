This is my clone of Evernote with Express, React, and redux with a retro 80’s
space theme. To match the notes with the notebook it belongs to I used
associations in the backend database to make sure the note stays with it’s
related notebook. I used a CKEditor api to add a text editor to the notes so
the user can style their notes more than just the plain text. To implement a
seamless user experience I created an auto save function with a setTimeout to
save the state every 4.5 seconds so the user doesn’t have to worry about
manually saving their notes.
