My group and I cloned SoundCloud using Python, React.js, Flask, and a theme of
angry music. To render an api that persists throughout the app to play song
files, We had to create a context in the state to constantly add, and take
away songs from the player itself based on which song/playlist you chose to
listen to. Using AWS we created a file upload system so users can create
their own songs and playlists with their unique album art. We had to build a
full route and multiple flask files and a full api route to react / redux to
render the newly made songs. To Create a seamless experience when creating,
editing, or deleting a comment we used Redux state to automatically listen
for those changes to dynamically render them.
